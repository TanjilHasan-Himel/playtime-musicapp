TERMS OF SERVICE AND END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)
App Name: Audia Player
Developer: Tanjil Hasan Himel
Version: 5.1.0
Effective Date: February 2, 2026

1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ACCEPTANCE
This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a binding legal contract between you ("User") and Tanjil Hasan Himel ("Developer"). By downloading, installing, or using the Audia Player mobile application ("the App"), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, you are strictly prohibited from using the App and must uninstall it immediately.

2. UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION (USP) & CORE FEATURES
Audia Player is defined by its commitment to Privacy, Fidelity, and Precision. By using the App, you acknowledge the following core functionalities:
• Precision Scheduler: Unlike standard players, Audia Player features a proprietary Audio Scheduling Engine. This allows users to program exact start times for local audio playback, functioning as a music alarm or automated background player.
• Data Sovereignty (Privacy First): The App operates entirely offline. We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell your personal data, listening habits, or device location. Your business is your own.
• Non-Destructive Operation: The App is designed with a "Read-Only" philosophy regarding your media files. The Scheduler and Playlist features organize your content but will never modify, corrupt, or delete your original audio files stored on the device.
• Local Storage: All databases (including Favorites, Playlists, and Schedules) are stored locally within the App’s private sandbox on your device. You retain full ownership and control of your data.

3. LICENSE GRANT
The Developer grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install, and use the App strictly for your personal, non-commercial use on devices owned or controlled by you.

4. USER CONTENT & COPYRIGHT COMPLIANCE
• Local Interface: The App acts solely as a sophisticated interface to organize and play audio files already stored on your device's internal memory or SD card.
• No Ownership Claim: The Developer does not claim ownership of any music or audio files accessed through the App.
• User Responsibility: You are solely responsible for ensuring you possess the legal rights (copyrights) to the content you play. You agree not to use the App to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.
• Smart Filtering: The App utilizes algorithms to categorize content (e.g., automatically hiding WhatsApp voice notes). While we strive for accuracy, the Developer is not liable for any content hidden, missed, or miscategorized by these automated filters.

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: SCHEDULER & ALARMS
You expressly acknowledge that the "Schedule Music" feature relies on the Android Operating System to execute precise timing.
• Battery Optimization Warning: Hardware manufacturers (including but not limited to Samsung, Xiaomi, Pixel, OnePlus) utilize aggressive battery-saving protocols (e.g., "Doze Mode," "App Standby," or "Task Killers") that may forcibly terminate background apps to save power.
• Waiver of Liability: While the App utilizes high-priority Foreground Services to ensure reliability, the Developer is NOT liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages (including missed flights, missed meetings, lost wages, or academic penalties) caused by:
1. Missed alarms or schedules due to Android OS battery optimization or task killing.
2. The device being powered off, out of battery, or in "Silent/DND Mode" during a scheduled event.
3. Conflicts with other third-party alarm or audio applications.

6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
The visual design, architecture, source code, and custom algorithms (including the Scheduler Logic, Smart Folder, and Miniplayer Sync) are the exclusive intellectual property of Tanjil Hasan Himel.
• Protection: You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on this App.
• Global Rights: These rights are protected by international copyright laws and treaties.

7. UPDATES & MODIFICATIONS
The Developer reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any feature (including the Scheduler or UI) at any time without notice. We may release updates to fix bugs or enhance features, but we are under no obligation to provide support or maintenance indefinitely.

8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM THE DEVELOPER SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.

9. INDEMNIFICATION (Universal Protection)
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Developer from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from:
1. Your use of the App.
2. Your violation of this Agreement.
3. Your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right.

10. GOVERNING LAW & JURISDICTION
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Bangladesh. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be instituted exclusively in the courts of the Developer's jurisdiction.

11. CONTACT INFORMATION
For technical support, bug reports, or legal inquiries, please contact the Developer directly.

PRIVACY POLICY
App Name: Audia Player | Developer: Tanjil Hasan Himel | Version: 5.1.0 Effective Date: February 2, 2026

1. OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT
Audia Player is designed with a "Data Sovereignty" philosophy. Unlike many modern applications, we do not monetize your data, track your location, or profile your listening habits.
We operate under a Zero-Knowledge Architecture: What you play, when you play it, and where you play it remains strictly between you and your device.

2. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
We do NOT collect, transmit, or store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or IP address.
A. Local Audio Data The App scans your device’s internal storage to identify audio files (MP3, WAV, AAC, etc.) for the sole purpose of displaying and playing them.
• No Uploads: This index is created and stored locally on your device. No file names or metadata are ever sent to a server.
B. Usage Data We do not use third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel). We do not track which buttons you press or how long you use the App.

3. APP PERMISSIONS
To function as a precision music player and scheduler, Audia Player requires specific permissions. We request these only to perform core features:
• Storage (Read Media/Audio): Required to access the music files stored on your device so you can create playlists.
• Foreground Service: Required to keep the "Precision Scheduler" and audio playback active when the screen is off or you are using other apps.
• Schedule Exact Alarm: Required to ensure your scheduled music starts at the exact second you requested, overriding standard battery-saving delays.
• Notifications: Used solely to display the playback controls (Play/Pause/Skip) in your status bar.

4. DATA STORAGE AND RETENTION
All data is local.
• Databases: Your Favorites, Playlists, Play Counts, and Schedule configurations are stored in a private database on your device's internal memory.
• Deletion: If you uninstall Audia Player, this database is permanently deleted by the Android System. We cannot recover this data for you because we do not have a copy of it.

5. ADVERTISING AND TRACKING
• No Ads: This App does not display third-party advertisements.
• No Trackers: This App does not contain any advertising IDs (AAID) or tracking pixels.

6. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Since Audia Player does not collect personal data, it is safe for use by children. We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13.

7. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
Since the App operates offline and does not transmit data to the cloud, your data remains subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction and is never transferred across international borders by the App.

8. SECURITY
We rely on the security features of your device’s operating system to protect your local data. Because we do not store your data on external servers, your data is immune to cloud-based data breaches involving our App.

9. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in legal regulations or App features. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App’s "About" section.
